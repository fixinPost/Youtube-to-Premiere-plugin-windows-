# Youtube-to-Premiere-plugin-windows-
A working plugin for my youtube to premiere code. to run this you'll need Python working with commandline and pip. 
pip install youtube-dl. you'll also need ffmpeg working in command line. 
This script will create three files in your 'Documents' folder: 'YTPPDone', 'YTPPBatch'. and 'YTPPDone'.
if premiere freezes when using the plugin, navigate to 'YTPPDone'', open it type something into it and save. this should unfreeze premiere. 
you can install this plugin for windows with https://install.anastasiy.com/
